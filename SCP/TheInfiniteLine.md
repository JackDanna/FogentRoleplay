## 🚇 ONE-SHOT TITLE: **“SCP-████ – The Parallel Line”**

### 📘 Premise

Three Class-D personnel have been assigned to **SCP-████** — a Foundation-controlled subway line that travels **between alternate realities** via anomalous stations. The Foundation has charted the first few stops, but **stations beyond the third** become  **increasingly unstable and uncharted** .

The players’ objective:

> " **Disembark at the next 3 stations. Record brief footage of the environment. Return to the tram. Do not interact. Do not remain on a station longer than 30 minutes.** "

But reality has other plans…

## 🧪 SCP-████ Overview

* **Object Class** : Thaumiel/Keter
* **Description** : An anomalous subway system that appears non-anomalous within its native station, but once in motion, shifts to  **parallel Earths** .
* The “train” is Foundation-made, built into the original anomaly (a 1930s electric tram system discovered in Berlin and relocated underground).
* Time is **nonlinear** while riding — each station is in a  **completely different reality** .
* Each Class-D test run has had **inconsistent memory recovery** after return.

## 🧭 One-Shot Structure (2 hours)

### 🎬 **ACT 1 – Briefing & Boarding (~15 minutes)**

* **Foundation Handler** (via intercom):

  “You will be disembarking at the next **three** stations. Document what you see and recover the beacons of the previous teams. Thirty minutes max outside. Doors close automatically. Do not engage with the inhabitants. If the tram leaves without you... your body stays there.”
* The tram begins to move. Lights flicker. The track begins to **split into glass-like threads** ahead — each one a  **branching worldline** .

### 🛤️ **ACT 2 – Three Stations, Three Realities (~75 minutes total)**

Each  **station lasts ~20–25 minutes** , including travel time and brief recovery scenes back on the tram.
